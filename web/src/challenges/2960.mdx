### [Count Tested Devices After Test Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-tested-devices-after-test-operations/)

- Keep track of the number of devices that have been tested
- Increment the count if the battery percentage is greater than the current count

```js copy
/**
 * @param {number[]} batteryPercentages
 * @return {number}
 */
var countTestedDevices = function (batteryPercentages) {
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < batteryPercentages.length; i++) {
    if (batteryPercentages[i] > count) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```
