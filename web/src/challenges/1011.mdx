### [Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

- Use binary search to find the capacity with min & max as the max weight & total weight respectively
- If the days to ship is less than or equal to the given days, move towards the left else move towards the right


```js copy
/**
 * @param {number[]} weights
 * @param {number} days
 * @return {number}
 */
var shipWithinDays = function (weights, days) {
  const [totalWeight, maxWeight] = getTotalAndMax(weights);
  let left = maxWeight, right = totalWeight;
  let ans = totalWeight;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    const daysToShip = getDaysToShip(weights, mid);

    if (daysToShip <= days) {
      ans = mid;
      right = mid - 1;
    } else {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  return ans;
};

function getTotalAndMax(arr) {
  let sum = 0, max = 0;

  for (const item of arr) {
    sum += item;
    if (max < item) {
      max = item;
    }
  }

  return [sum, max];
}

function getDaysToShip(weights, shipCapacity) {
  let days = 1, capacity = 0;
  for (const weight of weights) {
    if (capacity + weight > shipCapacity) {
      days += 1;
      capacity = 0;
    }

    capacity += weight;
  }

  return days;
}
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(n log(Max(weights)))
- Space: O(1)
