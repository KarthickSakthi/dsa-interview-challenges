### [Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

- Naive approach would be to calculate the sum of all the array elements before the current index for every element, in to a new array.
- Simpler and better approach would be to replace the current element by its sum with the previous element

```js copy
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var runningSum = function (nums) {
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    nums[i] += nums[i - 1];
  }
  return nums;
};
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
