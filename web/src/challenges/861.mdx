### [Score After Flipping Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/)

- Flip each row if it has more 0 in the first column (MSB will give the maximum value)
- For each column, maximize the number of 1s by flipping the column if it has more 0s than 1s

```js copy
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var matrixScore = function (grid) {
  const m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
  let sum = (1 << (n - 1)) * m; // Set the MSB to 1 for each row

  for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
    // Count the number of 1s in the column
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      // Flip the column if that row MSB was flipped
      count += grid[i][0] ? grid[i][j] : 1 - grid[i][j];
    }

    // Flip the column if it has more 0s than 1s
    sum += (1 << (n - 1 - j)) * Math.max(count, m - count);
  }

  return sum;
};
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(m \* n)
- Space: O(1)
