### [Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

- A good approach would be calculate the nth fibonacci number either recursively or iteratively
- As we know nth fibonacci number is sum of n-1 th and n-2th fibonacci numbers, we can start from 1st position till we calculate nth.

```js copy
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var fib = function (n) {
  // initialize 0th and 1st fibonacci numbers
  let fib1 = 0, fib2 = 1;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    temp = fib2;
    fib2 = fib1 + fib2; // next fibonacci number is sum of current and next
    fib1 = temp; // current fibonacci number is next fibonacci number
  }

  return fib1;
};
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
