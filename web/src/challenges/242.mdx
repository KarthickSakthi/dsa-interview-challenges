### [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram)

- Create an object called "count" , with key as character of string and value as count of that character in the string
- Loop through those two strings , one with increasing of count and other with decreasing of count

```js copy
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */

var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if(s.length !== t.length)
        return false;
    
    let count={};

    for(let char of s){
        count[char] = (count[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    for(let char of t){
        if(!count[char])
            return false;
         count[char]--;
    }
    return true;
};
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: 
  - O(1) : If the character set is fixed (e.g., ASCII), the space required for the count object is O(1) since the number of unique characters is constant (256 for extended ASCII).
  - O(k) : For Unicode or larger character sets, the space required could be O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the input.
